These are the results of a personal challenge I set for myself: code one project per day for thirty days. I focused on Javascript knowing that I needed a firmer grasp of how to manipulate `[state]` and control various aspects of the `DOM`. Finishing feels wonderful. I have certainly learned a lot. Have a peek at my work and I suggest you set a 30 day challenge for yourself. It's hands down one of the most efficient learning tactics I know.
