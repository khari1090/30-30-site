## Sometimes fear is a beautiful thing.

I was afraid to miss out on learning a second language so I moved to France and became fluent in french. I was afraid I would never understand javascript so I challenged myself to make 30 javascript projects in 31 days (this site). Now, I have FOMOOAAOTLANS - I’m afraid to miss out on the opportunity to be a **Basecamp Product Design Intern**.

(n) Fear of missing out on an amazing opportunity to learn a new skill

## Why Basecamp?

Basecamp is a company that values creativity, seamless collaboration, and the remote work environment. You build products that solve real problems for people like me. Your platform, as I see it, helps people execute their wildest dreams. I want to help.

## Why me?

I have worked as a Front End Web Developer and Graphic Design Instructor for the past 3 years. My work, both with an organization and as an independent contractor, has given me the opportunity to experience and enjoy working on the web. I am currently working to bring my vocation and avocation together; the Basecamp program, as I understand it, will enhance my skills and abilities.

My bachelor’s degree in Sociology provided me with the ability to view, analytically, elements of the human condition. My desire to shift my social science education to the web is built on my interest in bringing together both the human condition and my problem-solving skills.

Through my work at Bitfountain, I have developed a compassionate approach and commitment to helping people communicate better and more easily through design. Through my freelance work, I have learned to appreciate beautiful, modular code.

```ruby
<script>

const me = "Khari Slaughter"
const you = "Basecamp"
const independent = "I am accustomed to working alone."

function problemSolver(){
  if (me == "knows the answer"){
    This is a best case scenario. I hope that I do know
    the answer. This means an opportunity to complete
    a task with greater efficiency and expertise. I can also use
    this expertise to educate those around me;
}
  else {
    I probably know who to ask or where to look for the solution.
    This presents the opportunity to learn something new. Don’t
    we all love that? Also, everything learned should be
    viewed is an opportunity to help the team;
  }
}

function goodGuyToHaveOnTheTeam(){
  if (me == "can help"){
    I will. Period.
}
  else{
    I am learning every day how and when to use the word “no.” My
    mother once told me that sometimes happiness is one “no” away.
    Sometimes a “yes” can do more harm than good. Taking on a
    task with unrealistic time constraints could be the
    downfall of progress.
  }
}

function goRemote(){
  const iHaveDoneThisBefore = I have worked on a remote
  startup team.

  Bitfountain, an online education platform for
  developing and designing iOS applications through video lessons.
  In addition to day-to-day design tasks (UI assets, graphics, and
  website updates), I contributed more than 40 hours of video
  design instruction to the platform. Although the business
  tanked at the start of 2016, a selection of our courses can
  still be purchased on Teachable and Udemy.

  Our small remote team worked from around the globe to build
  the brand and the product. Spanning different time zones, we
  used Slack channels to maintain contact and google hangouts
  to share screens and have meetings when needed.
