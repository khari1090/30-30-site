## Goal
Create the typewriter effect where text appears using javascript.

## Result
I made the text appear. I would have liked to make a sequence of strings that appear character by character, deleted themselves character by character, and moved on to the next string in the array but I didn’t get that far. Another day I hope.

## Learned
I previously had no idea about `split()`, `shift()`, or `setTimeout()`.

## Issues
This thing isn’t dynamic. I didn’t make a user input or give it the ability to handle multiple different strings. It literally works one time and will rerun on browser refresh. Today I am certain that I am catching a cold.
