## Goal
Make an action game!

## Result
Okay, so that’s a bit of an overstatement but the game is somewhat amusing and can be frustrating (as it is intended to be).

## Learned
I manipulated CSS classes and made three different modes.

## Issues
At first my troll wasn’t moving but I remembered I had to set the `position` to `absolute` for the `top`/`left` parameters to have any effect.
