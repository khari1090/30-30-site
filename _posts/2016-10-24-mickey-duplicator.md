## Goal
Duplicate an image again and again using javascript.

## Result
Mickey mouse gets stickered all over the screen on button press. I initially thought I wanted him to get pasted all in a row but a little bit offset and I realized itâ€™s a little boring to just stack Mickey so I used random integers to decide the new location.

## Learned
How to add appendChild to duplicate the div.

## Issues
I would like to make the form submit using the `Enter` key. Also, sometimes more than one Mickey is displayed on button press...
