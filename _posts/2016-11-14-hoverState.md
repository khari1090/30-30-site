## Goal
Make an an image hover mask.

## Result
It works.

## Learned
I have been wanting to get this simple idea to work for a while now and iâ€™ve finally achieved it. There are two examples.

## Issues
This is not dynamic. I would have had to user js and I still might one of these days. I ended up adding the image urls in the CSS as background images. I initially thought it would work inside of image divs in the body but that proved to be ineffective for me.
