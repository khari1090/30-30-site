## Goal
Create in-line alerts for input field.

## Result
It works!

## Learned
I had trouble with this before. But this time It works. I had to toggle classes.

## Issues
I ended up making more classes than I needed to. I am still trying to get `+=[.alternativeClassIdentifier]` to work in javascript. Basically, I am unsure how to append to class names via JS.
