## Goal
Create in-line alerts for input field

## Result
It works!

## Learned
I had trouble with this before. But this time It works. I had to toggle classes.

## Issues
I ended up making more classes than i needed to. I am still trying to get `+= .[alternativeClassIdentifier]` to work in javascript.
