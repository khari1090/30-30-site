## Goal
Create a to-do list that stores data on browser refresh and resets with a reset `button`.

## Result
It works!

## Learned
I learned how to set and clear local storage. I get what JSON is now. I am happy to have been able to use a multi-line function. I used an `onload()` function (straightforward but this was the first time so far in this challenge)

## Issues
There were no unusual issues beyond the normal learning curve associated with learning a new skill. I am still a bit confused about global variables in JS. It seems that anything related to `document.getElementById()` cannot be set as a global variable and accessed inside of functions in the same script tag.
