## Goal
Make a gambling game.

## Result
Itâ€™s not the most entertaining game, but it works.

## Learned
I learned a similar lesson as with the Rock Paper Scissors: global variables and how increment and decrement numbers based on various parameters. This was also my first experience with radio selectors. Obtaining their input was new to me.

## Issues
I struggled to get the money amount to adjust accurately.
