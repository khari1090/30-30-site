## Goal
Make a toDo list that uses state to redraw the board and allows you to click on an item to delete it from the list. I could have kept the items and marked it as “done” pretty easily but removing a specific item at a specific index is more valuable for an exercise.

## Result
It finally works. I received a little bit of help on this one but i finally get the concept.

## Learned
Today I think i fully grasped how to use arguments in functions

## Issues
I had a hard time getting the index of the specific element to delete and using that in the delete function.
