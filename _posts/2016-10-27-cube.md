## Goal
Make a 3d cube using html/css

## Result
I actually made it. Pretty surprised.

## Learned
You can set divs as absolute inside of a container and manipulate the container without losing the relative positions of the contained divs. I was surprised that there was not more code involved. It’s not exactly pretty but it does the job. I learned how to add multiple 3d transform properties to a div. The formatting wasn’t exactly what i thought. It seems that you can’t add two 3d transform properties to the class list. You need to string them together in the same item. It feels a little less dynamic but sometimes that’s okay.

## Issues
I had a hard time getting the proper angles at first. Of course this was an extension of yesterday’s project with just two divs.
