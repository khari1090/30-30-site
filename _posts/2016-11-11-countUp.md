## Goal
Make a number continually count up without stopping.

## Result
It works. You know, some days in this challenge are not as ambitious as other days. I have a life outside of this project to maintain as well. This project is mildly pleasing though.

## Learned
This projects used `parseFloat()`. Without it, the code just spits "1's" all over the screen and doesn't actually increment the number.

## Issues
This one wasn't so bad.
