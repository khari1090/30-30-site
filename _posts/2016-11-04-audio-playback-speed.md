## Goal
Insert an audio clip and manipulate the start and end points for the audio clip via user input.

## Result
The original goal was a little buggy so I had to drop it. Now, all you can do is change the speed. This is the first step to making a little sampler that works in the browser. I would like to expand the concept and make it work for video. Shouldn't be too bad.

## Learned
The very basics of adding and controlling an audio element.

## Issues
Trying to add a second sample option using the same methods resulted in a buggy app. The functions conflicted and one would impede the other from working even when I added a reset parameter to the function.
