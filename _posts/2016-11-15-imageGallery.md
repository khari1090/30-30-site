## Goal
Make a simple image gallery.

## Result
It works.

## Learned
That I am now good at simply controlling state. It is easy to rearrange and add new photos. This code is flexible and simple.

## Issues
I would have liked to add more functionality. Iâ€™d have liked for horizontal scrolling in the gallery portion to be controlled by mouse positions or even have hover events for scrolling instead of needing to use the scrollbar. I had trouble with this task.
