## Goal
A while ago I was given a coding challenge which involved making a shopping cart app that could add and quantify items in a cart. While this doesn’t show the number of each item in the cart (although it could) you should be able to add /remove items to the cart and see the total change.

## Result
It works.

## Learned
I learned many things with this project. Namely key/value pairs in arrays, solidifying my understanding of arrays, adding and rounding of numbers in an array

## Issues
Besides the normal learning curve, this wasn’t so bad. I guess i had some trouble displaying the total properly and showing the prices/names of the foods at first but that came together pretty well in the end.
