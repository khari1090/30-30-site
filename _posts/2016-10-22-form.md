## Goal
Make a program that allows height and width to be edited using user input

## Result
I made an entire image editor: change background color, image filter, height/width, and opacity. Once you learn how to edit one thing in CSS itâ€™s pretty addictive.

## Learned
How to edit css styles using javascript.

## Issues
Sometimes the program is a little buggy and does not change settings so you have to hit refresh.
