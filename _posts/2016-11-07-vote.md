## Goal
Make a status bar that displays a ratio of up-votes/down-votes.

## Result
It works and actually required less code than I thought.

## Learned
This project expanded my concept of what `state` is. I thought that “state” was necessarily an array but it’s actually whatever you want it to be. I initially began this project pushing numbers into an array and grabbing the value of the array (length) when really all I needed to do was create `red=0` and `green=0` and increase those values by 1 with every respective button click. I then plugged those values into an equation.

## Issues
This project wasn’t so bad. My initial issues arrived from over complication of the problem. The simplest solutions are the best ones.
