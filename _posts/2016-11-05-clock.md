## Goal
Make a clock that shows the date and the time.

## Result:
It works.

## Learned
This project wasnâ€™t terribly complicated but it did take a little figuring out to get the months and days to display as words instead of integers as they do by default. This could be expanded to show different times around the globe on button press.

## Issues
*See above.*
