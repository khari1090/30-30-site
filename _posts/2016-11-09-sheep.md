## Goal
Make a quick animation that activates with an `onclick` action. Click on the sheep to view the animation. There is sound involved.

## Result
It works and I thought I would add a little sound clip that triggers on each click as well.

## Learned
Learned how to set the audio volume in js. Had some more practice with setting window timeout.

## Issues
None
