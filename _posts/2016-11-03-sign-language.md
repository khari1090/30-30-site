## Goal
Make an app that takes input, pushes to an array, and replaces each character with it’s respective sign language equivalent in .png format

## Result
It works

## Learned
How to make a field automatically run a function when anything inside changes. I feel like i may have made a small breakthrough

## Issues
This one wasn’t so bad. Nothing unusual to report.
