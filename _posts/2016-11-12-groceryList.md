## Goal
Make a grocery list. This is just another excuse to get a toDo list working the way that I want.

## Result
FINALLY!!! It works. There are features for marking items done and deleting them and moving them back and forth between `toBuy` and `bought` states.

## Learned
I learned a lot here and this is possibly my best code to date. I am proud. I learned how to make an array with a key/value pair structure. My first multidimensional array/state. This is going to come in handy when I begin dealing with more and more information in my projects. There has to be a way to manage more items and it’s not best practice to make more and more arrays although I could have done so.

## Issues
I struggled with getting the proper item in the array to splice/push. This was due to an incorrect calling of the array position. I have gained a lot of confidence with console.log and it’s power is unmatched for debugging. I also realize the amazing power of having many specific functions as opposed to multifunctional functions. They are so much easier to debug.
