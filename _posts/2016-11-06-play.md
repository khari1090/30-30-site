## Goal
Express how I feel right now. Well not really. Today was a day of failed projects but I am throwing in the towel now.

## Result
I made a button that plays a sound clip expressing how I feel about coding right now. I hope to look back on this fondly.

## Learned
Making this project? How to play an audio clip using a click event. It wasn’t complicated. Most of the time was spent on styling and have you seen the page? yea.

## Issues
I am very frustrated with my progress with deleting a clicked item from an array and redrawing the array. This issue has been one of the most frustrating hurdles for me. First it was drawing the array and managing state. I have the basics of that under wraps at this point and it’s pretty intuitive. **I have *GOT* to figure out how to delete a * *CLICKED** item from an array so I can get this toDO list completed and move on to more interesting projects like working with APIs (never happened in the 30 days by the way - *spoiler*). I am halfway done with my 30 day challenge and it’s finally hit me. The hardest part is coming up with new projects...
