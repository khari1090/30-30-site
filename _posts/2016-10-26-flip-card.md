## Goal
Make a card that flips over to reveal another side when you click it

## Result
I did it. It works.

## Learned
How to do a 2D transform in CSS. Stacking the divs and making the opposite face invisible.

## Issues
I am having an impossible time appending classes in CSS using javascript. Syntaxes that I thought would work flawlessly didn’t really get the job done. I would love to be able to make a sub class and just append those things when clicked but what I tried didn’t really work.
