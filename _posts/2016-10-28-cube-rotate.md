## Goal
Make the cube rotate to different faces on button press.

## Result
It works.

## Learned
Apparently you cannot name a function `top()` or `bottom()`.

## Issues
I had a hard time figuring out how I was going to get the cube to rotate. I ended up going with 6 separate buttons linked to 6 separate functions but I don’t think it’s the most efficient way.
