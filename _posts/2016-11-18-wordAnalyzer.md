## Goal
Count the number of words, consonants, and vowels in a string.

## Result
It works.

## Learned
I learned what I see as a clever little workaround for finding the number of words in a string. It’s not particularly pretty and I am sure there is a more elegant solution out there but this one does the job. It involved counting the spaces but then I had to append one more space every time for the count to accurately represent the number of words. I also learned how to use HTML tables. I will have to use them more.

## Issues
This program considers everything except spaces to be characters. That’s fine but if I had more time I would have narrowed the scope so that I could easily add consonants etc. I guess I didn’t understand how to say “only letters.” I probably should have referenced an array for matches.
