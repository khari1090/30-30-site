## Goal
Make a toDo list that allows for checking items off the list

## Result
It almost works but the state of the checked items is not saved when you add a new item which is disappointing

## Learned
It is valuable to specify “.className” or “.id” respectively when toggling classes or id. If it’s an ID, it will not change according to “.className”. This concept was frustrating at first.

## Issues
I was not able to get the items to stay crossed off when adding a new item.
